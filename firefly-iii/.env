# Firefly III authentication settings
#

#
# Firefly III supports a few authentication methods:
# - 'web' (default, uses built in DB)
# - 'remote_user_guard' for Authelia etc
# Read more about these settings in the documentation.
# https://docs.firefly-iii.org/how-to/firefly-iii/advanced/authentication/
#
# LDAP is no longer supported :(

#
# Firefly III generates a basic keypair for your OAuth tokens.
# If you want, you can overrule the key with your own (secure) value.
# It's also possible to set PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE or PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE
# if you're using Docker secrets or similar solutions for secret management

# The static cron job token can be useful when you use Docker and wish to manage cron jobs.
# 1. Set this token to any 32-character value (this is important!).
# 2. Use this token in the cron URL instead of a user's command line token that you can find in /profile
#

# You can fine tune the start-up of a Docker container by editing these environment variables.
# Use this at your own risk. Disabling certain checks and features may result in lots of inconsistent data.
# However if you know what you're doing you can significantly speed up container start times.
# Set each value to true to enable, or false to disable.

# Set this to true to build all locales supported by Firefly III.
# This may take quite some time (several minutes) and is generally not recommended.
# If you wish to change or alter the list of locales, start your Docker container with
# `docker run -v locale.gen:/etc/locale.gen -e DKR_BUILD_LOCALE=true`
